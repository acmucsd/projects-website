            ACM Projects is our quarterly projects program where students work in a tight knit team. The program gives students the opportunity to be hands-on outside of courses in fields such as AI, design, and software engineering. The program culminates in a projects showcase and the finished product looks great on resumes. We welcome all skill levels to apply!
